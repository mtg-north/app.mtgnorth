Created by Garrett Culos

# Features

## Lists
The corner stone of mtg north. Lists are comprised of several key features, adding / removing cards, versioning to track changes, tags for categorization, format validation, and sharable links. 

##### Versioning
The standard evolution of a deck is hard to track with current deck building tools. MTG North makes this easy, build a list, save it as version 1, play it in a few tournaments, make a few changes and save that as version 2, rinse and repeat.

##### Format Validation
validate your list is standard / commander / canadian highlander legal.

##### Sharing
sharable links (facebook embedded) for easy referencing.

##### Fork a list
for those familiar with version control, mtg north, will provide a way to fork (copy) another list, change it to match your own play style / meta, and then reference the host list's changes (perhaps ones you also want to merge into your list).

## Buylist
Buylists are is a list of set / foil / condition specific cards.
##### Current Pricing
Card prices are gathered from a variety of sources.

##### Embeddable link
Share your public buylists to get those must haves. These links are able to be embedded in any blog or post.

## Inventory
A private list of cards you have collected, set / foil / condition specific, with the most recent pricing. Understanding your collections valid is important for personal and economic reasons. Knowing when to ship-em and when to buy-em is key to building a solid collection.
